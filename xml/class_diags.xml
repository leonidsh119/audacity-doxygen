<para>Processing of the macros for recording bad events or performance monitoring. </para>    </briefdescription>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>The idea of these macros is that we can include them in release code at no risk. They</para><para>a) have almost zero performance impact. b) will not flood the log with events.</para><para>This is achieved by a countdown which stops recording in the log when the countdown is finished. The countdwon continues to count down so that we track how many times the event happens. </para>    </detaileddescription>
