<para>The metadata API allows libavformat to export metadata tags to a client application when demuxing. Conversely it allows a client application to set metadata when muxing.</para><para>Metadata is exported or set as pairs of key/value strings in the &apos;metadata&apos; fields of the <ref refid="struct_a_v_format_context" kindref="compound">AVFormatContext</ref>, <ref refid="struct_a_v_stream" kindref="compound">AVStream</ref>, <ref refid="struct_a_v_chapter" kindref="compound">AVChapter</ref> and <ref refid="struct_a_v_program" kindref="compound">AVProgram</ref> structs using the <ref refid="group__lavu__dict" kindref="compound">AVDictionary</ref> API. Like all strings in FFmpeg, metadata is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded Unicode. Note that metadata exported by demuxers isn&apos;t checked to be valid UTF-8 in most cases.</para><para>Important concepts to keep in mind:<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Keys are unique; there can never be 2 tags with the same key. This is also meant semantically, i.e., a demuxer should not knowingly produce several keys that are literally different but semantically identical. E.g., key=Author5, key=Author6. In this example, all authors must be placed in the same tag.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Metadata is flat, not hierarchical; there are no subtags. If you want to store, e.g., the email address of the child of producer Alice and actor Bob, that could have key=alice_and_bobs_childs_email_address.</para></listitem><listitem><para>Several modifiers can be applied to the tag name. This is done by appending a dash character (&apos;-&apos;) and the modifier name in the order they appear in the list below <ndash/> e.g. foo-eng-sort, not foo-sort-eng.<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>language <ndash/> a tag whose value is localized for a particular language is appended with the ISO 639-2/B 3-letter language code. For example: Author-ger=Michael, Author-eng=Mike The original/default language is in the unqualified &quot;Author&quot; tag. A demuxer should set a default if it sets any translated tag.</para></listitem><listitem><para>sorting <ndash/> a modified version of a tag that should be used for sorting will have &apos;-sort&apos; appended. E.g. artist=&quot;The Beatles&quot;, artist-sort=&quot;Beatles, The&quot;.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
</para></listitem><listitem><para>Demuxers attempt to export metadata in a generic format, however tags with no generic equivalents are left as they are stored in the container. Follows a list of generic tag names:</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
