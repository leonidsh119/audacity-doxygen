\subsection{Detailed Description}
John Chowning\textquotesingle{}s reverberator class. 

This class is derived from the C\+LM \hyperlink{class_j_c_rev}{J\+C\+Rev} function, which is based on the use of networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters. This class implements three series allpass units, followed by four parallel comb filters, and two decorrelation delay lines in parallel at the output.
