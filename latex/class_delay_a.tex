S\+TK allpass interpolating delay line class.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK allpass interpolating delay line class. 

This \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} subclass implements a fractional-\/length digital delay-\/line using a first-\/order allpass filter. A fixed maximum length of 4095 and a delay of 0.\+5 is set using the default constructor. Alternatively, the delay and maximum length can be set during instantiation with an overloaded constructor.

An allpass filter has unity magnitude gain but variable phase delay properties, making it useful in achieving fractional delays without affecting a signal\textquotesingle{}s frequency magnitude response. In order to achieve a maximally flat phase delay response, the minimum delay possible in this implementation is limited to a value of 0.\+5.
