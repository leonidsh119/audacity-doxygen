This is a simple \char`\"{}\+How-\/to\char`\"{} for creating build files for Microsoft Visual C++ via C\+Make and the C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt file


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install C\+Make if you haven\textquotesingle{}t got it already (\mbox{[}\href{http://www.cmake.org}{\tt http\+://www.\+cmake.\+org}\mbox{]}, minimum version required is 2.\+8).
\item If you want A\+S\+IO support you need to D/L the A\+S\+I\+O2 S\+DK from Steinberg, and place it according to \hyperlink{compile_windows_asio_msvc}{Building Portaudio for Windows with A\+S\+IO support using M\+S\+VC}
\item Run the C\+Make G\+UI application and browse to {\bfseries source files} directory and {\bfseries build} directory\+: a. The {\bfseries source files} directory ({\itshape \char`\"{}\+Where is the source code\char`\"{}}) is where the portaudio C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt file is located. b. The {\bfseries build} directory ({\itshape \char`\"{}\+Where to build the binaries\char`\"{}}) is pretty much anywhere you like. A common practice though is to have the build directory located {\bfseries outside} the source files tree (a so called \char`\"{}out-\/of-\/source build\char`\"{})
\item Click {\itshape Configure}. This will prompt you to select which build files to generate. {\bfseries Note} Only Microsoft Visual C++ build files currently supported!
\item In the C\+Make option list, enable the P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+U\+D\+I\+O\+\_\+xxx options you need, then click {\itshape Configure} again (Note that after this there are no options marked with red color)
\item Click {\itshape Generate} and you\textquotesingle{}ll now (hopefully) have your VS build files in your previously defined {\bfseries build} directory.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Both A\+S\+IO and DirectX S\+DK are automatically searched for by the C\+Make script, so if you have DirectX S\+DK installed and have placed the A\+S\+I\+O2 S\+DK according to point 2 above, you should be able to build portaudio with !\+Direct\+Sound and A\+S\+IO support.

Should you later on decide to change a portaudio option, just jump in at step 5 above (M\+S\+VC will then prompt you to reload projects/solutions/workspace)
