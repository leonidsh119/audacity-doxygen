\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK reed table class. 

This class implements a simple one breakpoint, non-\/linear reed function, as described by Smith (1986). This function is based on a memoryless non-\/linear spring model of the reed (the reed mass is ignored) which saturates when the reed collides with the mouthpiece facing.

See Mc\+Intyre, Schumacher, \& Woodhouse (1983), Smith (1986), Hirschman, Cook, Scavone, and others for more information.
