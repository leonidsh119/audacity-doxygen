\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK non-\/interpolating delay line class. 

This protected \hyperlink{class_filter}{Filter} subclass implements a non-\/interpolating digital delay-\/line. A fixed maximum length of 4095 and a delay of zero is set using the default constructor. Alternatively, the delay and maximum length can be set during instantiation with an overloaded constructor.

A non-\/interpolating delay line is typically used in fixed delay-\/length applications, such as for reverberation.
