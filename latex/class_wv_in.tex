S\+TK audio input abstract base class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Wv\+In.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK audio input abstract base class. 

This class provides common functionality for a variety of audio data input subclasses.

\hyperlink{class_wv_in}{Wv\+In} supports multi-\/channel data. It is important to distinguish the \hyperlink{instr_8cpp_a02d20b725355812062c8b0c91b172b61}{tick()} methods, which return samples produced by averaging across sample frames, from the tick\+Frame() methods, which return references or pointers to multi-\/channel sample frames.

Both interleaved and non-\/interleaved data is supported via the use of Stk\+Frames objects.
