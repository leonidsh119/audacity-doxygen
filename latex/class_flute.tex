S\+TK flute physical model class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Flute.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK flute physical model class. 

This class implements a simple flute physical model, as discussed by Karjalainen, Smith, Waryznyk, etc. The jet model uses a polynomial, a la Cook.

This is a digital waveguide model, making its use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford University, Yamaha, and others.
