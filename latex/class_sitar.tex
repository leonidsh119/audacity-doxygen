S\+TK sitar string model class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Sitar.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK sitar string model class. 

This class implements a sitar plucked string physical model based on the Karplus-\/\+Strong algorithm.

This is a digital waveguide model, making its use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford University, Yamaha, and others. There exist at least two patents, assigned to Stanford, bearing the names of Karplus and/or Strong.
