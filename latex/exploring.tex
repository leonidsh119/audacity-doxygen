Now that you have a good idea of how Port\+Audio works, you can try out the example programs. You\textquotesingle{}ll find them in the examples/ directory in the Port\+Audio distribution.

For an example of playing a sine wave, see examples/paex\+\_\+sine.\+c.

For an example of recording and playing back a sound, see examples/paex\+\_\+record.\+c.

I also encourage you to examine the source for the Port\+Audio libraries. If you have suggestions on ways to improve them, please let us know. If you want to implement Port\+Audio on a new platform, please let us know as well so we can coordinate people\textquotesingle{}s efforts.
