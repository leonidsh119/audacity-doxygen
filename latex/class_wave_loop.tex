S\+TK waveform oscillator class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Wave\+Loop.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK waveform oscillator class. 

This class inherits from \hyperlink{class_file_wv_in}{File\+Wv\+In} and provides audio file looping functionality. Any audio file that can be loaded by \hyperlink{class_file_read}{File\+Read} can be looped using this class.

\hyperlink{class_wave_loop}{Wave\+Loop} supports multi-\/channel data. It is important to distinguish the \hyperlink{instr_8cpp_a02d20b725355812062c8b0c91b172b61}{tick()} methods, which return samples produced by averaging across sample frames, from the tick\+Frame() methods, which return references or pointers to multi-\/channel sample frames.
