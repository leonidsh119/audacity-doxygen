S\+TK audio file input class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$File\+Wv\+In.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK audio file input class. 

This class inherits from \hyperlink{class_wv_in}{Wv\+In}. It provides a \char`\"{}tick-\/level\char`\"{} interface to the \hyperlink{class_file_read}{File\+Read} class. It also provides variable-\/rate \char`\"{}playback\char`\"{} functionality. Audio file support is provided by the \hyperlink{class_file_read}{File\+Read} class. Linear interpolation is used for fractional \char`\"{}read
rates\char`\"{}.

\hyperlink{class_file_wv_in}{File\+Wv\+In} supports multi-\/channel data. It is important to distinguish the \hyperlink{instr_8cpp_a02d20b725355812062c8b0c91b172b61}{tick()} methods, which return samples produced by averaging across sample frames, from the tick\+Frame() methods, which return references to multi-\/channel sample frames.

\hyperlink{class_file_wv_in}{File\+Wv\+In} will either load the entire content of an audio file into local memory or incrementally read file data from disk in chunks. This behavior is controlled by the optional constructor arguments {\itshape chunk\+Threshold} and {\itshape chunk\+Size}. File sizes greater than {\itshape chunk\+Threshold} (in sample frames) will be read incrementally in chunks of {\itshape chunk\+Size} each (also in sample frames).

When the file end is reached, subsequent calls to the \hyperlink{instr_8cpp_a02d20b725355812062c8b0c91b172b61}{tick()} functions return zero-\/valued data and is\+Finished() returns {\itshape true}.

See the \hyperlink{class_file_read}{File\+Read} class for a description of the supported audio file formats.
