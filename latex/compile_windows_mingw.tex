From the \mbox{[}\href{http://www.mingw.org}{\tt http\+://www.\+mingw.\+org} Min\+GW projectpage\mbox{]}\+:

Min\+GW\+: A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific header files and import libraries, augmenting the G\+NU Compiler Collection, (G\+CC), and its associated tools, (G\+NU binutils). Min\+GW provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is suitable for the development of native Windows programs that do not depend on any 3rd-\/party C runtime D\+L\+Ls.

M\+S\+YS\+: A Minimal S\+Y\+Stem providing a P\+O\+S\+IX compatible Bourne shell environment, with a small collection of U\+N\+IX command line tools. Primarily developed as a means to execute the configure scripts and Makefiles used to build Open Source software, but also useful as a general purpose command line interface to replace Windows cmd.\+exe.

Min\+GW provides a compiler/linker toolchain while M\+S\+YS is required to actually run the Port\+Audio configure script.

Once Min\+GW and M\+S\+YS are installed (see the \mbox{[}\href{http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki}{\tt http\+://www.\+mingw.\+org/\+Min\+G\+Wiki} Min\+G\+W-\/\+Wiki\mbox{]}) open an M\+S\+YS shell and run the famous\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./\hyperlink{namespacewaflib_1_1extras_1_1autowaf_aed9c0237757b6bbcc7a442d726e82c47}{configure}
make
make install
\end{DoxyCode}


The above should create a working version though you might want to provide \textquotesingle{}--prefix=$<$path-\/to-\/install-\/dir$>$\textquotesingle{} to configure.

\textquotesingle{}./configure --help\textquotesingle{} gives details as to what can be tinkered with.
