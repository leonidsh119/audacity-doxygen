S\+TK sinusoid oscillator class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Sine\+Wave.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK sinusoid oscillator class. 

This class computes and saves a static sine \char`\"{}table\char`\"{} that can be shared by multiple instances. It has an interface similar to the \hyperlink{class_wave_loop}{Wave\+Loop} class but inherits from the \hyperlink{class_generator}{Generator} class. Output values are computed using linear interpolation.

The \char`\"{}table\char`\"{} length, set in \hyperlink{_sine_wave_8h}{Sine\+Wave.\+h}, is 2048 samples by default.
