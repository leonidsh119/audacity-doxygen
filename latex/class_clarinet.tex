S\+TK clarinet physical model class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Clarinet.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK clarinet physical model class. 

This class implements a simple clarinet physical model, as discussed by Smith (1986), Mc\+Intyre, Schumacher, Woodhouse (1983), and others.

This is a digital waveguide model, making its use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford University, Yamaha, and others.
