S\+TK audio file input class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$File\+Read.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK audio file input class. 

This class provides input support for various audio file formats. Multi-\/channel ($>$2) soundfiles are supported. The file data is returned via an external Stk\+Frames object passed to the read() function. This class does not store its own copy of the file data, rather the data is read directly from disk.

\hyperlink{class_file_read}{File\+Read} currently supports uncompressed W\+AV, A\+I\+F\+F/\+A\+I\+FC, S\+ND (AU), M\+A\+T-\/file (Matlab), and S\+TK R\+AW file formats. Signed integer (8-\/, 16-\/, and 32-\/bit) and floating-\/point (32-\/ and 64-\/bit) data types are supported. Compressed data types are not supported.

S\+TK R\+AW files have no header and are assumed to contain a monophonic stream of 16-\/bit signed integers in big-\/endian byte order at a sample rate of 22050 Hz. M\+A\+T-\/file data should be saved in an array with each data channel filling a matrix row. The sample rate for M\+A\+T-\/files is assumed to be 44100 Hz.
