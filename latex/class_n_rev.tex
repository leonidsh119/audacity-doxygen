\subsection{Detailed Description}
C\+C\+R\+MA\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_n_rev}{N\+Rev} reverberator class. 

This class is derived from the C\+LM \hyperlink{class_n_rev}{N\+Rev} function, which is based on the use of networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters. This particular arrangement consists of 6 comb filters in parallel, followed by 3 allpass filters, a lowpass filter, and another allpass in series, followed by two allpass filters in parallel with corresponding right and left outputs.
