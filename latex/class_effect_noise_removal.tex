A two-\/pass effect to remove background noise.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A two-\/pass effect to remove background noise. 

The first pass is done over just noise. For each windowed sample of the sound, we take a F\+FT and then statistics are tabulated for each frequency band -\/ specifically the maximum level achieved by at least (n) sampling windows in a row, for various values of (n).

During the noise removal phase, we start by setting a gain control for each frequency band such that if the sound has exceeded the previously-\/determined threshold, the gain is set to 0, otherwise the gain is set lower (e.\+g. -\/18 dB), to suppress the noise. Then frequency-\/smoothing is applied so that a single frequency is never suppressed or boosted in isolation, and then time-\/smoothing is applied so that the gain for each frequency band moves slowly. Lookahead is employed; this effect is not designed for real-\/time but if it were, there would be a significant delay.

The gain controls are applied to the complex F\+FT of the signal, and then the inverse F\+FT is applied, followed by a Hanning window; the output signal is then pieced together using overlap/add of half the window size.
