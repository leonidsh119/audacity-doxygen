Processing of the macros for recording bad events or performance monitoring.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Processing of the macros for recording bad events or performance monitoring. 

The idea of these macros is that we can include them in release code at no risk. They

a) have almost zero performance impact. b) will not flood the log with events.

This is achieved by a countdown which stops recording in the log when the countdown is finished. The countdwon continues to count down so that we track how many times the event happens. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
