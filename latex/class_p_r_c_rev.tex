{\ttfamily \#include $<$P\+R\+C\+Rev.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Perry\textquotesingle{}s simple reverberator class. 

This class is based on some of the famous Stanford/\+C\+C\+R\+MA reverbs (\hyperlink{class_n_rev}{N\+Rev}, Kip\+Rev), which were based on the Chowning/\+Moorer/\+Schroeder reverberators using networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters. This class implements two series allpass units and two parallel comb filters.
