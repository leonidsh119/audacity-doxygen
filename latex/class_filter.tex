S\+TK filter class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Filter.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK filter class. 

This class implements a generic structure that can be used to create a wide range of filters. It can function independently or be subclassed to provide more specific controls based on a particular filter type.

In particular, this class implements the standard difference equation\+:

a\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}$\ast$y\mbox{[}n\mbox{]} = b\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}$\ast$x\mbox{[}n\mbox{]} + ... + b\mbox{[}nb\mbox{]}$\ast$x\mbox{[}n-\/nb\mbox{]} -\/ a\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}$\ast$y\mbox{[}n-\/1\mbox{]} -\/ ... -\/ a\mbox{[}na\mbox{]}$\ast$y\mbox{[}n-\/na\mbox{]}

If a\mbox{[}0\mbox{]} is not equal to 1, the filter coeffcients are normalized by a\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}.

The {\itshape gain} parameter is applied at the filter input and does not affect the coefficient values. The default gain value is 1.\+0. This structure results in one extra multiply per computed sample, but allows easy control of the overall filter gain.
