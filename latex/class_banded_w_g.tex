Banded waveguide modeling class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Banded\+W\+G.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Banded waveguide modeling class. 

This class uses banded waveguide techniques to model a variety of sounds, including bowed bars, glasses, and bowls. For more information, see Essl, G. and Cook, P. "Banded Waveguides\+: Towards Physical Modelling of Bar Percussion Instruments", Proceedings of the 1999 International Computer Music Conference.
