S\+TK faux conical bore reed instrument class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Saxofony.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
S\+TK faux conical bore reed instrument class. 

This class implements a \char`\"{}hybrid\char`\"{} digital waveguide instrument that can generate a variety of wind-\/like sounds. It has also been referred to as the \char`\"{}blowed string\char`\"{} model. The waveguide section is essentially that of a string, with one rigid and one lossy termination. The non-\/linear function is a reed table. The string can be \char`\"{}blown\char`\"{} at any point between the terminations, though just as with strings, it is impossible to excite the system at either end. If the excitation is placed at the string mid-\/point, the sound is that of a clarinet. At points closer to the \char`\"{}bridge\char`\"{}, the sound is closer to that of a saxophone. See Scavone (2002) for more details.

This is a digital waveguide model, making its use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford University, Yamaha, and others.
