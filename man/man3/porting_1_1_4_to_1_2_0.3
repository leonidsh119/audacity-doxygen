This module describes porting from \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.1\&.4 to \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.2\&.0\&.  
This module describes porting from \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.1\&.4 to \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.2\&.0\&. 

There were only very minor changes to the interfaces from 1\&.1\&.4 to 1\&.2\&.0\&. In libFLAC, \fC\fBFLAC__format_sample_rate_is_subset()\fP\fP was added\&. In libFLAC++, \fC\fBFLAC::Decoder::Stream::get_decode_position()\fP\fP was added\&.
.PP
Finally, value of the constant \fCFLAC__FRAME_HEADER_RESERVED_LEN\fP has changed to reflect the conversion of one of the reserved bits into active use\&. It used to be \fC2\fP and now is \fC1\fP\&. However the \fBFLAC\fP frame header length has not changed, so to skip the proper number of bits, use \fCFLAC__FRAME_HEADER_RESERVED_LEN\fP + \fCFLAC__FRAME_HEADER_BLOCKING_STRATEGY_LEN\fP
