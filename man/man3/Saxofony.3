STK faux conical bore reed instrument class\&. 

This class implements a 'hybrid' digital waveguide instrument that can generate a variety of wind-like sounds\&. It has also been referred to as the 'blowed string' model\&. The waveguide section is essentially that of a string, with one rigid and one lossy termination\&. The non-linear function is a reed table\&. The string can be 'blown' at any point between the terminations, though just as with strings, it is impossible to excite the system at either end\&. If the excitation is placed at the string mid-point, the sound is that of a clarinet\&. At points closer to the 'bridge', the sound is closer to that of a saxophone\&. See Scavone (2002) for more details\&.

This is a digital waveguide model, making its use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford University, Yamaha, and others\&.
