Perry's simple reverberator class\&. 

This class is based on some of the famous Stanford/CCRMA reverbs (\fBNRev\fP, KipRev), which were based on the Chowning/Moorer/Schroeder reverberators using networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters\&. This class implements two series allpass units and two parallel comb filters\&.
