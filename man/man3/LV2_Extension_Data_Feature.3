.PP 
.SS "\fBconst\fP \fBvoid\fP*(* LV2_Extension_Data_Feature::data_access) (\fBconst\fP char *\fBuri\fP)"
A pointer to a method the UI can call to get data (of a type specified by some other extension) from the plugin\&.
.PP
This call never is never guaranteed to return anything, UIs should degrade gracefully if direct access to the plugin data is not possible (in which case this function will return NULL)\&.
.PP
This is for access to large data that can only possibly work if the UI and plugin are running in the same process\&. For all other things, use the normal LV2 UI communication system\&.
