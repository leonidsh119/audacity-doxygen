.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
STK audio input abstract base class\&. 

This class provides common functionality for a variety of audio data input subclasses\&.
.PP
\fBWvIn\fP supports multi-channel data\&. It is important to distinguish the \fBtick()\fP methods, which return samples produced by averaging across sample frames, from the tickFrame() methods, which return references or pointers to multi-channel sample frames\&.
.PP
Both interleaved and non-interleaved data is supported via the use of StkFrames objects\&.
