.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A type of factory for Commands of various sorts\&. 

\fBCommandBuilder\fP has the task of deciding what command is meant by a given command string, and producing a suitable command object\&. For now, it doesn't actually do any processing - it just passes everything on to the BatchCommand system by constructing BatchCommandEval objects\&.
