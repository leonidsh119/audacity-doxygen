.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
\fBAudioIO\fP uses the PortAudio library to play and record sound\&. 

Great care and attention to detail are necessary for understanding and modifying this system\&. The code in this file is run from three different thread contexts: the UI thread, the disk thread (which this file creates and maintains; in the code, this is called the Audio Thread), and the PortAudio callback thread\&. To highlight this deliniation, the file is divided into three parts based on what thread context each function is intended to run in\&.
.PP
\fBEXPERIMENTAL_MIDI_PLAYBACK\fP
.RS 4
If EXPERIMENTAL_MIDI_PLAYBACK is defined, this class also manages MIDI playback\&. The reason for putting MIDI here rather than in, say, class MidiIO, is that there is no high-level synchronization and transport architecture, so Audio and MIDI must be coupled in order to start/stop/pause and synchronize them\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMIDI With Audio\fP
.RS 4
When Audio and MIDI play simultaneously, MIDI synchronizes to Audio\&. This is necessary because the Audio sample clock is not the same hardware as the system time used to schedule MIDI messages\&. MIDI is synchronized to Audio because it is simple to pause or rush the dispatch of MIDI messages, but generally impossible to pause or rush synchronous audio samples (without distortion)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\fP
.RS 4
MIDI output is driven by yet another thread\&. In principle, we could output timestamped MIDI data at the same time we fill audio buffers from disk, but audio buffers are filled far in advance of playback time, and there is a lower latency thread (PortAudio's callback) that actually sends samples to the output device\&. The relatively low latency to the output device allows Audacity to stop audio output quickly\&. We want the same behavior for MIDI, but there is not periodic callback from PortMidi (because MIDI is asynchronous), so this function is performed by the MidiThread class\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\fP
.RS 4
When Audio is running, MIDI is synchronized to Audio\&. Globals are set in the Audio callback (audacityAudioCallback) for use by a time function that reports milliseconds to PortMidi\&. (Details below\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBMIDI Without Audio\fP
.RS 4
When Audio is not running, PortMidi uses its own millisecond timer since there is no audio to synchronize to\&. (Details below\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fBImplementation Notes and Details for MIDI\fP
.RS 4
When opening devices, successAudio and successMidi indicate errors if false, so normally both are true\&. Use playbackChannels, captureChannels and mMidiPlaybackTracks\&.IsEmpty() to determine if Audio or MIDI is actually in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBAudio Time\fP
.RS 4
Normally, the current time during playback is given by the variable mTime\&. mTime normally advances by frames / samplerate each time an audio buffer is output by the audio callback\&. However, Audacity has a speed control that can perform continuously variable time stretching on audio\&. This is achieved in two places: the playback 'mixer' that generates the samples for output processes the audio according to the speed control\&. In a separate algorithm, the audio callback updates mTime by (frames / samplerate) * factor, where factor reflects the speed at mTime\&. This effectively integrates speed to get position\&. Negative speeds are allowed too, for instance in scrubbing\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMidi Time\fP
.RS 4
MIDI is not warped according to the speed control\&. This might be something that should be changed\&. (Editorial note: Wouldn't it make more sense to display audio at the correct time and allow users to stretch audio the way they can stretch MIDI?) For now, MIDI plays at 1 second per second, so it requires an unwarped clock\&. In fact, MIDI time synchronization requires a millisecond clock that does not pause\&. Note that mTime will stop progress when the Pause button is pressed, even though audio samples (zeros) continue to be output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\fP
.RS 4
Therefore, we define the following interface for MIDI timing: 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCAudioTime()\fP is the time based on all samples written so far, including zeros output during pauses\&. AudioTime() is based on the start location mT0, not zero\&. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCPauseTime()\fP is the amount of time spent paused, based on a count of zero samples output\&. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCMidiTime()\fP is an estimate in milliseconds of the current audio output time + 1s\&. In other words, what audacity track time corresponds to the audio (including pause insertions) at the output?
.PP
.RE
.PP
\fBAudioTime() and PauseTime() computation\fP
.RS 4
AudioTime() is simply mT0 + mNumFrames / mRate\&. mNumFrames is incremented in each audio callback\&. Similarly, PauseTime() is mNumPauseFrames / mRate\&. mNumPauseFrames is also incremented in each audio callback when a pause is in effect\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMidiTime() computation\fP
.RS 4
MidiTime() is computed based on information from PortAudio's callback, which estimates the system time at which the current audio buffer will be output\&. Consider the (unimplemented) function RealToTrack() that maps real time to track time\&. If outputTime is PortAudio's time estimate for the most recent output buffer, then 
.br
 RealToTrack(outputTime) = AudioTime() - PauseTime() - bufferDuration 
.br
 We want to know RealToTrack of the current time, so we use this approximation for small d: 
.br
 RealToTrack(t + d) = RealToTrack(t) + d 
.br
 Letting t = outputTime and d = (systemTime - outputTime), we can substitute to get:
.br
 RealToTrack(systemTime) = AudioTime() - PauseTime() - bufferduration + (systemTime - outputTime) 
.br
 MidiTime() should include pause time, so add PauseTime() to both sides of the equation\&. Also MidiTime() is offset by 1 second to avoid negative time at startup, so add 1 to both sides: MidiTime() in seconds = RealToTrack(systemTime) + PauseTime() + 1 = 
.br
 AudioTime() - bufferduration + (systemTime - outputTime) + 1
.RE
.PP
\fB\fP
.RS 4
The difference AudioTime() - PauseTime() is the time 'cursor' for MIDI\&. When the speed control is used, MIDI and Audio will become unsynchronized\&. In particular, MIDI will not be synchronized with the visual cursor, which moves with scaled time reported in mTime\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMidi Synchronization\fP
.RS 4
The goal of MIDI playback is to deliver MIDI messages synchronized to audio (assuming no speed variation for now)\&. If a midi event has time tmidi, then the timestamp for that message should be 
.br
 timestamp (in seconds) = tmidi + PauseTime() + 1\&.0 - latency\&.
.br
 (This is actually off by 1ms; see 'PortMidi Latency Parameter' below for more detail\&.) Notice the extra 1\&.0, added because MidiTime() is offset by 1s to avoid starting at a negative value\&. Also notice that we subtract latency\&. The user must set device latency using preferences\&. Some software synthesizers have very high latency (on the order of 100ms), so unless we lower timestamps and send messages early, the final output will not be synchronized\&. This timestamp is interpreted by PortMidi relative to MidiTime(), which is synchronized to audio output\&. So the only thing we need to do is output Midi messages shortly before they will be played with the correct timestamp\&. We will take 'shortly before' to mean 'at about the same time
  as corresponding audio'\&. Based on this, output the event when AudioTime() - PauseTime() > mtime - latency, adjusting the event time by adding PauseTime() + 1 - latency\&. This gives at least mAudioOutputLatency for the MIDI output to be generated (we want to generate MIDI output before the actual output time because events generated early are accurately timed according to their timestamp)\&. However, the MIDI thread sleeps for MIDI_SLEEP in its polling loop, so the worst case is really mAudioOutputLatency + MIDI_SLEEP\&. In case the audio output latency is very low, we will output events when AudioTime() + MIDI_SLEEP - PauseTime() > mtime - latency\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBInteraction between MIDI, Audio, and Pause\fP
.RS 4
When Pause is used, PauseTime() will increase at the same rate as AudioTime(), and no more events will be output\&. Because of the time advance of mAudioOutputLatency + MIDI_SLEEP + latency and the fact that AudioTime() advances stepwise by mAudioBufferDuration, some extra MIDI might be output, but the same is true of audio: something like mAudioOutputLatency audio samples will be in the output buffer (with up to mAudioBufferDuration additional samples, depending on when the Pause takes effect)\&. When playback is resumed, there will be a slight delay corresponding to the extra data previously sent\&. Again, the same is true of audio\&. Audio and MIDI will not pause and resume at exactly the same times, but their pause and resume times will be within the low tens of milliseconds, and the streams will be synchronized in any case\&. I\&.e\&. if audio pauses 10ms earlier than MIDI, it will resume 10ms earlier as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPortMidi Latency Parameter\fP
.RS 4
PortMidi has a 'latency' parameter that is added to all timestamps\&. This value must be greater than zero to enable timestamp-based timing, but serves no other function, so we will set it to 1\&. All timestamps must then be adjusted down by 1 before messages are sent\&. This adjustment is on top of all the calculations described above\&. It just seem too complicated to describe everything in complete detail in one place\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMidi While Recording Only\fP
.RS 4
All of the midi-to-audio synchronization is of course meaningless when audio is not playing\&. If only recording, there is the problem that synchronization is based on output time, but without audio output, there is no output time\&. This does not seem like a critical feature, so MIDI is not synchronized to audio without audio playback\&. The user can always play a track of silence while recording to synchronize\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMidi Without Audio Playback\fP
.RS 4
When there is no audio playback, MIDI runs according to its own clock\&. The midi timestamp clock starts at approximately the same time as audio recording (if any)\&. A timestamp of 0 corresponds to mT0, the starting time in the Midi track(s)\&. Thus the timestamp for an event at time tmidi should be: 
.br
 timestamp = tmidi - mT0 + PauseTime() - latency - 0\&.001
.br
 Where latency is the synthesizer latency, and the extra 0\&.001 is the latency (1ms) that PortMidi adds to timestamps automatically\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMidi Output Without Audio Playback\fP
.RS 4
Midi events should be written before their timestamp expires\&. Since the loop that checks for events to write pauses for MIDI_SLEEP, the events should be written at least MIDI_SLEEP early, and due to other delays and computation, we want some extra time, so let's allow 2*MIDI_SLEEP\&. Therefore, the write time should be when:
.br
 tmidi - mT0 + PauseTime() - latency - 0\&.001 - 2 * MIDI_SLEEP < \fBPt_Time()\fP
.br
, which can be rearranged to:
.br
 tmidi < mT0 + \fBPt_Time()\fP + MIDI_SLEEP + (MIDI_SLEEP + latency) - PauseTime
.br
 which matches the code in AudioIO::FillMidiBuffers() after converting ms to s appropriately\&. (Note also that the 0\&.001 is dropped here -- it's not really important)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBThe code for Midi Without Audio was developed by simply trying\fP
.RS 4
to play Midi alone and fixing everything that did not work\&. The 'normal' \fBAudioIO\fP execution was full of assumptions about audio, so there is no systematic design for running without audio, merely a number of 'patches' to make it work\&. The expression 'mNumPlaybackChannels > 0' is used to detect whether audio playback is active, and 'mNumFrames > 0' is used to indicate that playback of either Midi or Audio has actually started\&. (mNumFrames is normally incremented by the audio callback, but if there is no audio playback or recording, it is set to 1 at the end of initialization\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNoteTrack PlayLooped\fP
.RS 4
When mPlayLooped is true, output is supposed to loop from mT0 to mT1\&. For NoteTracks, we interpret this to mean that any note-on or control change in the range mT0 <= t < mT1 is sent (notes that start before mT0 are not played even if they extend beyond mT0)\&. Then, all notes are turned off\&. Events in the range mT0 <= t < mT1 are then repeated, offset by (mT1 - mT0), etc\&. We do NOT go back to the beginning and play all control changes (update events) up to mT0, nor do we 'undo' any state changes between mT0 and mT1\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNoteTrack PlayLooped Implementation\fP
.RS 4
The mIterator object (an \fBAlg_iterator\fP) returns NULL when there are no more events scheduled before mT1\&. At mT1, we want to output all notes off messages, but the FillMidiBuffers() loop will exit if mNextEvent is NULL, so we create a 'fake' mNextEvent for this special 'event' of sending all notes off\&. After that, we destroy the iterator and use PrepareMidiIterator() to set up a NEW one\&. At each iteration, time must advance by (mT1 - mT0), so the accumulated time is held in mMidiLoopOffset\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBTodo\fP
.RS 4
run through all functions called from audio and portaudio threads to verify they are thread-safe\&. Note that synchronization of the style: 'A sets flag to signal B, B clears flag to acknowledge completion' is not thread safe in a general multiple-CPU context\&. For example, B can write to a buffer and set a completion flag\&. The flag write can occur before the buffer write due to out-of-order execution\&. Then A can see the flag and read the buffer before buffer writes complete\&.

Get a list of sample rates the current input/output device combination supports\&.
