.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Given a string representing a command, pass it to the \fBBatchCommands\fP system\&. 

The eventual aim is to move the code from \fBBatchCommands\fP out into separate command classes, but until this happens, \fBBatchEvalCommand\fP can act as a 'bridge' to that system\&.
