.PP 
LV2 Plugin Worker Interface\&.
.PP
This is the interface provided by the plugin to implement a worker method\&. The plugin's extension_data() method should return an LV2_Worker_Interface when called with LV2_WORKER__interface as its argument\&.

.PP 
.SS "\fBLV2_Worker_Status\fP(* _LV2_Worker_Interface::end_run) (\fBLV2_Handle\fP instance)"
Called when all responses for this cycle have been delivered\&.
.PP
Since \fBwork_response()\fP may be called after \fBrun()\fP finished, this provides a hook for code that must run after the cycle is completed\&.
.PP
This field may be NULL if the plugin has no use for it\&. Otherwise, the host MUST call it after every \fBrun()\fP, regardless of whether or not any responses were sent that cycle\&.

Definition at line 112 of file worker\&.h\&.
.SS "\fBLV2_Worker_Status\fP(* _LV2_Worker_Interface::work) (\fBLV2_Handle\fP instance, \fBLV2_Worker_Respond_Function\fP respond, \fBLV2_Worker_Respond_Handle\fP handle, \fBuint32_t\fP \fBsize\fP, \fBconst\fP \fBvoid\fP *\fBdata\fP)"
The worker method\&. This is called by the host in a non-realtime context as requested, possibly with an arbitrary message to handle\&.
.PP
A response can be sent to \fBrun()\fP using \fCrespond\fP\&. The plugin MUST NOT make any assumptions about which thread calls this method, other than the fact that there are no real-time requirements\&.

.br
\fIrespond\fP A function for sending a response to \fBrun()\fP\&. 
.br
\fIhandle\fP Must be passed to \fCrespond\fP if it is called\&. 
.br
\fIsize\fP The size of \fCdata\fP\&.
