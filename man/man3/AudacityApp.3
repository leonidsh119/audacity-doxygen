This function is called before processing any event and allows the application to preempt the processing of some events, see wxEventFilter documentation for more information\&.

.SS "\fBint\fP AudacityApp::OnExit (\fBvoid\fP)\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
Override this member function for any processing which needs to be done as the application is about to exit\&. OnExit is called after destroying all application windows and controls, but before wxWidgets cleanup\&. Note that it is not called at all if \fBOnInit()\fP failed\&.
.PP
The return value of this function is currently ignored, return the same value as returned by the base class method if you override it\&.

Reimplemented from \fBwxAppConsole\fP\&.

.SS "\fBvoid\fP AudacityApp::OnFatalException ()\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
This function may be called if something fatal happens: an unhandled exception under Win32 or a fatal signal under Unix, for example\&. However, this will not happen by default: you have to explicitly call \fBwxHandleFatalExceptions()\fP to enable this\&.
.PP
Generally speaking, this function should only show a message to the user and return\&. You may attempt to save unsaved data but this is not guaranteed to work and, in fact, probably won't\&.

.SS "\fBbool\fP AudacityApp::OnInit (\fBvoid\fP)\fC [override]\fP, \fC [virtual]\fP"
This must be provided by the application, and will usually create the application's main window, optionally calling \fBSetTopWindow()\fP\&.
.PP
You may use \fBOnExit()\fP to clean up anything initialized here, provided that the function returns \&.
.PP
Notice that if you want to use the command line processing provided by wxWidgets you have to call the base class version in the derived class \fBOnInit()\fP\&.
.PP
Return  to continue processing,  to exit the application immediately\&.
