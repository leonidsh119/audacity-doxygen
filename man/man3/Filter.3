.PP 
STK filter class\&. 

This class implements a generic structure that can be used to create a wide range of filters\&. It can function independently or be subclassed to provide more specific controls based on a particular filter type\&.
.PP
In particular, this class implements the standard difference equation:
.PP
a[0]*y[n] = b[0]*x[n] + \&.\&.\&. + b[nb]*x[n-nb] - a[1]*y[n-1] - \&.\&.\&. - a[na]*y[n-na]
.PP
If a[0] is not equal to 1, the filter coeffcients are normalized by a[0]\&.
.PP
The \fIgain\fP parameter is applied at the filter input and does not affect the coefficient values\&. The default gain value is 1\&.0\&. This structure results in one extra multiply per computed sample, but allows easy control of the overall filter gain\&.
