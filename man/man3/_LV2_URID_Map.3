Opaque pointer to host data\&.
.PP
This MUST be passed to map_uri() whenever it is called\&. Otherwise, it must not be interpreted in any way\&.

.SS "\fBLV2_URID\fP(* _LV2_URID_Map::map) (\fBLV2_URID_Map_Handle\fP \fBhandle\fP, \fBconst\fP char *\fBuri\fP)"
Get the numeric ID of a URI\&.
.PP
If the ID does not already exist, it will be created\&.
.PP
This function is referentially transparent; any number of calls with the same arguments is guaranteed to return the same value over the life of a plugin instance\&. Note, however, that several \fBURIs\fP MAY resolve to the same ID if the host considers those \fBURIs\fP equivalent\&.
.PP
This function is not necessarily very fast or RT-safe: plugins SHOULD cache any IDs they might need in performance critical situations\&.
.PP
The return value 0 is reserved and indicates that an ID for that URI could not be created for whatever reason\&. However, hosts SHOULD NOT return 0 from this function in non-exceptional circumstances (i\&.e\&. the URI map SHOULD be dynamic)\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIhandle\fP Must be the callback_data member of this struct\&. 
.br
\fIuri\fP The URI to be mapped to an integer ID\&.
