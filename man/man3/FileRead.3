.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
STK audio file input class\&. 

This class provides input support for various audio file formats\&. Multi-channel (>2) soundfiles are supported\&. The file data is returned via an external StkFrames object passed to the read() function\&. This class does not store its own copy of the file data, rather the data is read directly from disk\&.
.PP
\fBFileRead\fP currently supports uncompressed WAV, AIFF/AIFC, SND (AU), MAT-file (Matlab), and STK RAW file formats\&. Signed integer (8-, 16-, and 32-bit) and floating-point (32- and 64-bit) data types are supported\&. Compressed data types are not supported\&.
.PP
STK RAW files have no header and are assumed to contain a monophonic stream of 16-bit signed integers in big-endian byte order at a sample rate of 22050 Hz\&. MAT-file data should be saved in an array with each data channel filling a matrix row\&. The sample rate for MAT-files is assumed to be 44100 Hz\&.
