open_default_stream \- Opening a Stream Using Defaults 
The next step is to open a stream, which is similar to opening a file\&. You can specify whether you want audio input and/or output, how many channels, the data format, sample rate, etc\&. Opening a ''default'' stream means opening the default input and output devices, which saves you the trouble of getting a list of devices and choosing one from the list\&. (We'll see how to do that later\&.)

                                                   tells PortAudio to pick the best,
                                                   possibly changing, buffer size\&.*/

                                                   your callback*/

The data structure and callback are described in \fBWriting a Callback Function\fP\&.
.PP
The above example opens the stream for writing, which is sufficient for playback\&. It is also possible to open a stream for reading, to do recording, or both reading and writing, for simultaneous recording and playback or even real-time audio processing\&. If you plan to do playback and recording at the same time, open only one stream with valid input and output parameters\&.
.PP
There are some caveats to note about simultaneous read/write:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Some platforms can only open a read/write stream using the same device\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Although multiple streams can be opened, it is difficult to synchronize them\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Some platforms don't support opening multiple streams on the same device\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Using multiple streams may not be as well tested as other features\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The PortAudio library calls must be made from the same thread or synchronized by the user\&.
