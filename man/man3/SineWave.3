.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
STK sinusoid oscillator class\&. 

This class computes and saves a static sine 'table' that can be shared by multiple instances\&. It has an interface similar to the \fBWaveLoop\fP class but inherits from the \fBGenerator\fP class\&. Output values are computed using linear interpolation\&.
.PP
The 'table' length, set in \fBSineWave\&.h\fP, is 2048 samples by default\&.
