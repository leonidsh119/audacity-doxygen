.PP 
Use the interpolation code to fill in damaged audio\&. Damage can include pops, clicks, or clipping\&. As long as the damaged section is short and surrounded by lots of good audio, it is usually quite successful\&. 

This was formerly the PopClickRemoval effect, but it was renamed and focused on the smaller subproblem of repairing the audio, rather than actually finding the clicks\&.
