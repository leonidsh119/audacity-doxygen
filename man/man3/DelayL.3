.PP 
STK linear interpolating delay line class\&. 

This \fBDelay\fP subclass implements a fractional- length digital delay-line using first-order linear interpolation\&. A fixed maximum length of 4095 and a delay of zero is set using the default constructor\&. Alternatively, the delay and maximum length can be set during instantiation with an overloaded constructor\&.
.PP
Linear interpolation is an efficient technique for achieving fractional delay lengths, though it does introduce high-frequency signal attenuation to varying degrees depending on the fractional delay setting\&. The use of higher order Lagrange interpolators can typically improve (minimize) this attenuation characteristic\&.
