.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A \fBPrefsPanel\fP that presents an interface for user to view the default bindings of mouse buttons to commands\&. 

April/2003: These are default bindings and are not yet configurable\&. They are provided to give information about what the bindings are\&.
.PP
Configuration when available will be mostly used by power users who are unlikely to change the default bindings, but will add bindings (e\&.g\&. for cut, play, and their own nyquist filters) using currently unused combinations\&.
.PP
Unlike key-bindings which are parameterless, mouse bindings provide parameters:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
a single point for a click, and
.IP "\(bu" 2
a stream of points or a start and end point for a drag\&.
.PP
.PP
If we allow a nyquist filter to be bound to the mouse, instead of being applied to the current selection it would be applied to the start and end points of the drag\&.
