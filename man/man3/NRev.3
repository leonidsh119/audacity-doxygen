CCRMA's \fBNRev\fP reverberator class\&. 

This class is derived from the CLM \fBNRev\fP function, which is based on the use of networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters\&. This particular arrangement consists of 6 comb filters in parallel, followed by 3 allpass filters, a lowpass filter, and another allpass in series, followed by two allpass filters in parallel with corresponding right and left outputs\&.
