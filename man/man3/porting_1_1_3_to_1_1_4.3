This module describes porting from \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.1\&.3 to \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.1\&.4\&.  
This module describes porting from \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.1\&.3 to \fBFLAC\fP 1\&.1\&.4\&. 

There were no changes to any of the interfaces from 1\&.1\&.3 to 1\&.1\&.4\&. There was a slight change in the implementation of \fBFLAC__stream_encoder_set_metadata()\fP; the function now makes a copy of the \fImetadata\fP array of pointers so the client no longer needs to maintain it after the call\&. The objects themselves that are pointed to by the array are still not copied though and must be maintained until the call to \fBFLAC__stream_encoder_finish()\fP\&.
