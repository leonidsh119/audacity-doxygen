.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
STK waveform oscillator class\&. 

This class inherits from \fBFileWvIn\fP and provides audio file looping functionality\&. Any audio file that can be loaded by \fBFileRead\fP can be looped using this class\&.
.PP
\fBWaveLoop\fP supports multi-channel data\&. It is important to distinguish the \fBtick()\fP methods, which return samples produced by averaging across sample frames, from the tickFrame() methods, which return references or pointers to multi-channel sample frames\&.
