Prototype for plugin accessor function\&.
.PP
Plugins are discovered by hosts using RDF data (not by loading libraries)\&. See http://lv2plug.in for details on the discovery process, though most hosts should use an existing library to implement this functionality\&.
.PP
This is the simple plugin discovery API, suitable for most statically defined plugins\&. Advanced plugins that need access to their bundle during discovery can use \fBlv2_lib_descriptor()\fP instead\&. Plugin libraries MUST include a function called 'lv2_descriptor' or 'lv2_lib_descriptor' with C-style linkage, but SHOULD provide 'lv2_descriptor' wherever possible\&.
.PP
When it is time to load a plugin (designated by its URI), the host loads the plugin's library, gets the \fBlv2_descriptor()\fP function from it, and uses this function to find the LV2_Descriptor for the desired plugin\&. Plugins are accessed by index using values from 0 upwards\&. This function MUST return NULL for out of range indices, so the host can enumerate plugins by increasing \fCindex\fP until NULL is returned\&.
.PP
Note that \fCindex\fP has no meaning, hosts MUST NOT depend on it remaining consistent between loads of the plugin library\&.
.PP
The \fBlv2_descriptor()\fP function is the entry point to the plugin library\&. The host will load the library and call this function repeatedly with increasing indices to find all the plugins defined in the library\&. The index is not an indentifier, the URI of the returned descriptor is used to determine the identify of the plugin\&.
.PP
This method is in the ``discovery'' threading class, so no other functions or methods in this plugin library will be called concurrently with it\&.
