From the [http://www.mingw.org MinGW projectpage]:
.PP
MinGW: A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific header files and import libraries, augmenting the GNU Compiler Collection, (GCC), and its associated tools, (GNU binutils)\&. MinGW provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is suitable for the development of native Windows programs that do not depend on any 3rd-party C runtime DLLs\&.
.PP
MSYS: A Minimal SYStem providing a POSIX compatible Bourne shell environment, with a small collection of UNIX command line tools\&. Primarily developed as a means to execute the configure scripts and Makefiles used to build Open Source software, but also useful as a general purpose command line interface to replace Windows cmd\&.exe\&.
.PP
MinGW provides a compiler/linker toolchain while MSYS is required to actually run the PortAudio configure script\&.
.PP
Once MinGW and MSYS are installed (see the [http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki MinGW-Wiki]) open an MSYS shell and run the famous:
.PP
.PP
.nf
\&./configure
make
make install
.fi
.PP
.PP
The above should create a working version though you might want to provide '--prefix=<path-to-install-dir>' to configure\&.
.PP
'\&./configure --help' gives details as to what can be tinkered with\&.
