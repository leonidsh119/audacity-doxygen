.PP 
This class is essential for writing console-only or hybrid apps without having to define \fCwxUSE_GUI=0\fP\&.
.PP
It is used to: 
.PD 0

.IP "\(bu" 2
set and get application-wide properties (see \fBwxAppConsole::CreateTraits\fP and wxAppConsole::SetXXX functions) 
.IP "\(bu" 2
implement the windowing system message or event loop: events in fact are supported even in console-mode applications (see \fBwxAppConsole::HandleEvent\fP and \fBwxAppConsole::ProcessPendingEvents\fP); 
.IP "\(bu" 2
initiate application processing via \fBwxApp::OnInit\fP; 
.IP "\(bu" 2
allow default processing of events not handled by other objects in the application (see \fBwxAppConsole::FilterEvent\fP) 
.IP "\(bu" 2
implement Apple-specific event handlers (see wxAppConsole::MacXXX functions)
.PP
You should use the macro \fBwxIMPLEMENT_APP(appClass)\fP in your application implementation file to tell wxWidgets how to create an instance of your application class\&.
.PP
Use \fBwxDECLARE_APP(appClass)\fP in a header file if you want the \fBwxGetApp()\fP function (which returns a reference to your application object) to be visible to other files\&.

.SS "\fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::DeletePendingEvents ()"
Deletes the pending events of all wxEvtHandlers of this application\&.
.PP
See wxEvtHandler::DeletePendingEvents() for warnings about deleting the pending events\&. 
.SS "virtual \fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::ExitMainLoop ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Call this to explicitly exit the main message (event) loop\&. You should normally exit the main loop (and the application) by deleting the top window\&.
.PP
This function simply calls wxEvtLoopBase::Exit() on the active loop\&. 
.SS "virtual \fBint\fP wxAppConsole::FilterEvent (wxEvent & event)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Overridden wxEventFilter method\&.
.PP
This function is called before processing any event and allows the application to preempt the processing of some events, see wxEventFilter documentation for more information\&.
.PP
\fBwxApp\fP implementation of this method always return -1 indicating that the event should be processed normally\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented in \fBAudacityApp\fP\&.
.SS "wxString wxAppConsole::GetAppDisplayName () const"
Returns the user-readable application name\&.
.PP
The difference between this string and the one returned by \fBGetAppName()\fP is that this one is meant to be shown to the user and so should be used for the window titles, page headers and so on while the other one should be only used internally, e\&.g\&. for the file names or configuration file keys\&.
.PP
If the application name for display had been previously set by \fBSetAppDisplayName()\fP, it will be returned by this function\&. Otherwise, if \fBSetAppName()\fP had been called its value will be returned; also as is\&. Finally if none was called, this function returns the program name capitalized using wxString::Capitalize()\&.

.SS "wxEventLoopBase* wxAppConsole::GetMainLoop () const"
Returns the main event loop instance, i\&.e\&. the event loop which is started by \fBOnRun()\fP and which dispatches all events sent from the native toolkit to the application (except when new event loops are temporarily set-up)\&. The returned value maybe \&. Put initialization code which needs a non- main event loop into \fBOnEventLoopEnter()\fP\&. 
.SS "wxAppTraits* wxAppConsole::GetTraits ()"
Returns a pointer to the wxAppTraits object for the application\&. If you want to customize the wxAppTraits object, you must override the \fBCreateTraits()\fP function\&. 
.SS "\fBconst\fP wxString& wxAppConsole::GetVendorDisplayName () const"
Returns the user-readable vendor name\&. The difference between this string and the one returned by \fBGetVendorName()\fP is that this one is meant to be shown to the user and so should be used for the window titles, page headers and so on while the other one should be only used internally, e\&.g\&. for the file names or configuration file keys\&.

.SS "virtual \fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::HandleEvent (wxEvtHandler * handler, wxEventFunction func, wxEvent & event) const\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function simply invokes the given method \fIfunc\fP of the specified event handler \fIhandler\fP with the \fIevent\fP as parameter\&. It exists solely to allow to catch the C++ exceptions which could be thrown by all event handlers in the application in one place: if you want to do this, override this function in your wxApp-derived class and add try/catch clause(s) to it\&. 
.SS "\fBbool\fP wxAppConsole::HasPendingEvents () const"
Returns  if there are pending events on the internal pending event list\&.
.PP
Whenever wxEvtHandler::QueueEvent or wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent() are called (not only for \fBwxApp\fP itself, but for any event handler of the application!), the internal \fBwxApp\fP's list of handlers with pending events is updated and this function will return true\&. 
.SS "static \fBbool\fP wxAppConsole::IsMainLoopRunning ()\fC [static]\fP"
Returns  if the main event loop is currently running, i\&.e\&. if the application is inside \fBOnRun()\fP\&.
.PP
This can be useful to test whether events can be dispatched\&. For example, if this function returns , non-blocking sockets cannot be used because the events from them would never be processed\&. 
.SS "\fBbool\fP wxAppConsole::IsScheduledForDestruction (wxObject * object) const"
Check if the object had been scheduled for destruction with \fBScheduleForDestruction()\fP\&.
.PP
This function may be useful as an optimization to avoid doing something with an object which will be soon destroyed in any case\&. 
.SS "virtual \fBint\fP wxAppConsole::MainLoop ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Called by wxWidgets on creation of the application\&. Override this if you wish to provide your own (environment-dependent) main loop\&.

This function is called when an assert failure occurs, i\&.e\&. the condition specified in wxASSERT() macro evaluated to \&.
.PP
It is only called in debug mode (when \fC\fBWXDEBUG\fP\fP is defined) as asserts are not left in the release code at all\&. The base class version shows the default assert failure dialog box proposing to the user to stop the program, continue or ignore all subsequent asserts\&.
.PP

.SS "virtual \fBbool\fP wxAppConsole::OnExceptionInMainLoop ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function is called if an unhandled exception occurs inside the main application event loop\&. It can return  to ignore the exception and to continue running the loop or  to exit the loop and terminate the program\&. In the latter case it can also use C++ \fCthrow\fP keyword to rethrow the current exception\&.
.PP
The default behaviour of this function is the latter in all ports except under Windows where a dialog is shown to the user which allows him to choose between the different options\&. You may override this function in your class to do something more appropriate\&.
.PP
Finally note that if the exception is rethrown from here, it can be caught in \fBOnUnhandledException()\fP\&. 
.SS "virtual \fBint\fP wxAppConsole::OnExit ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Override this member function for any processing which needs to be done as the application is about to exit\&. OnExit is called after destroying all application windows and controls, but before wxWidgets cleanup\&. Note that it is not called at all if \fBOnInit()\fP failed\&.
.PP
The return value of this function is currently ignored, return the same value as returned by the base class method if you override it\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented in \fBAudacityApp\fP\&.
.SS "virtual \fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::OnFatalException ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function may be called if something fatal happens: an unhandled exception under Win32 or a fatal signal under Unix, for example\&. However, this will not happen by default: you have to explicitly call \fBwxHandleFatalExceptions()\fP to enable this\&.
.PP
Generally speaking, this function should only show a message to the user and return\&. You may attempt to save unsaved data but this is not guaranteed to work and, in fact, probably won't\&.

.PP
Reimplemented in \fBAudacityApp\fP\&.
.SS "virtual \fBbool\fP wxAppConsole::OnInit ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
This must be provided by the application, and will usually create the application's main window, optionally calling SetTopWindow()\&.
.PP
You may use \fBOnExit()\fP to clean up anything initialized here, provided that the function returns \&.
.PP
Notice that if you want to use the command line processing provided by wxWidgets you have to call the base class version in the derived class \fBOnInit()\fP\&.
.PP
Return  to continue processing,  to exit the application immediately\&. 
.PP
Reimplemented in \fBAudacityApp\fP\&.
.SS "virtual \fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::OnInitCmdLine (wxCmdLineParser & parser)\fC [virtual]\fP"
Called from \fBOnInit()\fP and may be used to initialize the parser with the command line options for this application\&. The base class versions adds support for a few standard options only\&. 
.SS "virtual \fBint\fP wxAppConsole::OnRun ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
This virtual function is where the execution of a program written in wxWidgets starts\&. The default implementation just enters the main loop and starts handling the events until it terminates, either because \fBExitMainLoop()\fP has been explicitly called or because the last frame has been deleted and GetExitOnFrameDelete() flag is  (this is the default)\&.
.PP
The return value of this function becomes the exit code of the program, so it should return 0 in case of successful termination\&. 
.SS "virtual \fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::OnUnhandledException ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
This function is called when an unhandled C++ exception occurs in user code called by wxWidgets\&.
.PP
Any unhandled exceptions thrown from (overridden versions of) \fBOnInit()\fP and \fBOnExit()\fP methods as well as any exceptions thrown from inside the main loop and re-thrown by \fBOnUnhandledException()\fP will result in a call to this function\&.
.PP
By the time this function is called, the program is already about to exit and the exception can't be handled nor ignored any more, override \fBOnUnhandledException()\fP or use explicit \fCtry/catch\fP blocks around \fBOnInit()\fP body to be able to handle the exception earlier\&.
.PP
The default implementation dumps information about the exception using wxMessageOutputBest\&. 
.SS "virtual \fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::ProcessPendingEvents ()\fC [virtual]\fP"
Process all pending events; it is necessary to call this function to process events posted with wxEvtHandler::QueueEvent or wxEvtHandler::AddPendingEvent\&.
.PP
This happens during each event loop iteration (see wxEventLoopBase) in GUI mode but it may be also called directly\&.
.PP
Note that this function does not only process the pending events for the \fBwxApp\fP object itself (which derives from wxEvtHandler) but also the pending events for \fIany\fP event handler of this application\&.
.PP
This function will immediately return and do nothing if \fBSuspendProcessingOfPendingEvents()\fP was called\&. 
.SS "\fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::ResumeProcessingOfPendingEvents ()"
Resume processing of the pending events previously stopped because of a call to \fBSuspendProcessingOfPendingEvents()\fP\&. 
.SS "\fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::ScheduleForDestruction (wxObject * object)"
Delayed objects destruction\&.
.PP
In applications using events it may be unsafe for an event handler to delete the object which generated the event because more events may be still pending for the same object\&. In this case the handler may call \fBScheduleForDestruction()\fP instead\&. Schedule the object for destruction in the near future\&.
.PP
Notice that if the application is not using an event loop, i\&.e\&. if \fBUsesEventLoop()\fP returns , this method will simply delete the object immediately\&.
.PP
Examples of using this function inside wxWidgets itself include deleting the top level windows when they are closed and sockets when they are disconnected\&. 
.SS "\fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::SetAppDisplayName (\fBconst\fP wxString & name)"
Set the application name to be used in the user-visible places such as window titles\&.
.PP
See \fBGetAppDisplayName()\fP for more about the differences between the display name and name\&.
.PP
Notice that if this function is called, the name is used as is, without any capitalization as done by default by \fBGetAppDisplayName()\fP\&. 
.SS "\fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::SetAppName (\fBconst\fP wxString & name)"
Sets the name of the application\&. This name should be used for file names, configuration file entries and other internal strings\&. For the user-visible strings, such as the window titles, the application display name set by \fBSetAppDisplayName()\fP is used instead\&.
.PP
By default the application name is set to the name of its executable file\&.

.SS "\fBvoid\fP wxAppConsole::SetCLocale ()"
Sets the C locale to the default locale for the current environment\&.
.PP
It is advised to call this to ensure that the underlying toolkit uses the locale in which the numbers and monetary amounts are shown in the format expected by user and so on\&.
.PP
Calling this function is roughly equivalent to calling 
.PP
.nf
setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

.fi
.PP
 but performs additional toolkit-specific tasks under some platforms and so should be used instead of \fCsetlocale()\fP itself\&. Alternatively, you can use wxLocale to change the locale with more control\&.
.PP
Notice that this does \fInot\fP change the global C++ locale, you need to do it explicitly if you want, e\&.g\&. 
.PP
.nf
std::locale::global(std::locale(""));

.fi
.PP
 but be warned that locale support in C++ standard library can be poor or worse under some platforms, e\&.g\&. the above line results in an immediate crash under OS X up to the version 10\&.8\&.2\&.

.PP
This function always returns  for the GUI applications which must use an event loop but by default only returns  for the console programs if an event loop is already running as it can't know whether one will be created in the future\&.
.PP
Thus, it only makes sense to override it in console applications which do use an event loop, to return  instead of checking if there is a currently active event loop\&.
