terminating_portaudio \- Closing a Stream and Terminating PortAudio 
When you are done with a stream, you should close it to free up resources:
.PP
.PP
.nf
err = Pa_CloseStream( stream );
if( err != paNoError ) goto error;
.fi
.PP
.PP
We've already mentioned this in \fBInitializing PortAudio\fP, but in case you forgot, be sure to terminate PortAudio when you are done:
.PP
.PP
.nf
err = Pa_Terminate( );
if( err != paNoError ) goto error;
.fi
