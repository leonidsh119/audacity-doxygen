.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A simple \fBFFT\fP implementation provided for convenience of plugin authors\&.
.PP
This class provides double-precision FFTs in power-of-two sizes only\&. It is slower than more sophisticated library implementations\&. If these requirements aren't suitable, make other arrangements\&.
.PP
The inverse transform is scaled by 1/n\&.
.PP
The implementation is from Don Cross's public domain \fBFFT\fP code\&.

.PP 
.SS "\fBvoid\fP Vamp::FFT::forward (unsigned \fBint\fP n, \fBconst\fP double * ri, \fBconst\fP double * ii, double * ro, double * io)\fC [static]\fP"
Calculate a forward transform of size n\&.
.PP
ri and ii must point to the real and imaginary component arrays of the input\&. For real input, ii may be NULL\&.
.PP
ro and io must point to enough space to receive the real and imaginary component arrays of the output\&.
.PP
All input and output arrays are of size n\&.

.SS "\fBvoid\fP Vamp::FFT::inverse (unsigned \fBint\fP n, \fBconst\fP double * ri, \fBconst\fP double * ii, double * ro, double * io)\fC [static]\fP"
Calculate an inverse transform of size n\&.
.PP
ri and ii must point to the real and imaginary component arrays of the input\&. For real input, ii may be NULL\&.
.PP
ro and io must point to enough space to receive the real and imaginary component arrays of the output\&. The output is scaled by 1/n\&. The output pointers may not be NULL, even if the output is expected to be real\&.
.PP
All input and output arrays are of size n\&.
