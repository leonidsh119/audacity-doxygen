This function can be used by plugins to create files and directories, either at state saving time (if this feature is passed to \fBLV2_State_Interface\&.save()\fP) or any time (if this feature is passed to \fBLV2_Descriptor\&.instantiate()\fP)\&.
.PP
The host MUST do whatever is necessary for the plugin to be able to create a file at the returned path (e\&.g\&. using fopen), including creating any leading directories\&.
.PP
If this function is passed to \fBLV2_Descriptor\&.instantiate()\fP, it may be called from any non-realtime context\&. If it is passed to \fBLV2_State_Interface\&.save()\fP, it may only be called within the dynamic scope of that function call\&.
.PP
The caller is responsible for freeing the returned value with free()\&.
