John Chowning's reverberator class\&. 

This class is derived from the CLM \fBJCRev\fP function, which is based on the use of networks of simple allpass and comb delay filters\&. This class implements three series allpass units, followed by four parallel comb filters, and two decorrelation delay lines in parallel at the output\&.
