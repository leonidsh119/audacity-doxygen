.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
An atom-like message used internally to apply/free samples\&.
.PP
This is only used internally to communicate with the worker, it is never sent to the outside world via a port since it is not POD\&. It is convenient to use an Atom header so actual atoms can be easily sent through the same ringbuffer\&.
