Host API implementation supporting AudioScience cards via the Linux HPI interface\&. 


.SS "Overview"
.PP
This is a PortAudio implementation for the AudioScience HPI Audio API on the Linux platform\&. AudioScience makes a range of audio adapters customised for the broadcasting industry, with support for both Windows and Linux\&. More information on their products can be found on their website:

.SS "Implementation strategy"
.PP
Note* Ideally, AudioScience cards should be handled by the PortAudio ALSA implementation on Linux, as ALSA is the preferred Linux soundcard API\&. The existence of this host API implementation might therefore seem a bit flawed\&. Unfortunately, at the time of the creation of this implementation (June 2006), the PA ALSA implementation could not make use of the existing AudioScience ALSA driver\&. PA ALSA uses the 'memory-mapped' (mmap) ALSA access mode to interact with the ALSA library, while the AudioScience ALSA driver only supports the 'read-write' access mode\&. The appropriate solution to this problem is to add 'read-write' support to PortAudio ALSA, thereby extending the range of soundcards it supports (AudioScience cards are not the only ones with this problem)\&. Given the author's limited knowledge of ALSA and the simplicity of the HPI API, the second-best solution was born\&.\&.\&.
.PP
The following mapping between HPI and PA was followed: HPI subsystem => PortAudio host API HPI adapter => nothing specific HPI stream => PortAudio device
.PP
Each HPI stream is either input or output (not both), and can support different channel counts, sampling rates and sample formats\&. It is therefore a more natural fit to a PA device\&. A PA stream can therefore combine two HPI streams (one input and one output) into a 'full-duplex' stream\&. These HPI streams can even be on different physical adapters\&. The two streams ought to be sample-synchronised when they reside on the same adapter, as most AudioScience adapters derive their ADC and DAC clocks from one master clock\&. When combining two adapters into one full-duplex stream, however, the use of a word clock connection between the adapters is strongly recommended\&.
.PP
The HPI interface is inherently blocking, making use of read and write calls to transfer data between user buffers and driver buffers\&. The callback interface therefore requires a helper thread ('callback engine') which periodically transfers data (one thread per PA stream, in fact)\&. The current implementation explicitly sleeps via \fBPa_Sleep()\fP until enough samples can be transferred (select() or poll() would be better, but currently seems impossible\&.\&.\&.)\&. The thread implementation makes use of the Unix thread helper functions and some pthread calls here and there\&. If a unified PA thread exists, this host API implementation might also compile on Windows, as this is the only real Linux-specific part of the code\&.
.PP
There is no inherent fixed buffer size in the HPI interface, as in some other host APIs\&. The PortAudio implementation contains a buffer that is allocated during OpenStream and used to transfer data between the callback and the HPI driver buffer\&. The size of this buffer is quite flexible and is derived from latency suggestions and matched to the requested callback buffer size as far as possible\&. It can become quite huge, as the AudioScience cards are typically geared towards higher-latency applications and contain large hardware buffers\&.
.PP
The HPI interface natively supports most common sample formats and sample rates (some conversion is done on the adapter itself)\&.
.PP
Stream time is measured based on the number of processed frames, which is adjusted by the number of frames currently buffered by the HPI driver\&.
.PP
There is basic support for detecting overflow and underflow\&. The HPI interface does not explicitly indicate this, so thresholds on buffer levels are used in combination with stream state\&. Recovery from overflow and underflow is left to the PA client\&.
.PP
Blocking streams are also implemented\&. It makes use of the same polling routines that the callback interface uses, in order to prevent the allocation of variable-sized buffers during reading and writing\&. The framesPerBuffer parameter is therefore still relevant, and this can be increased in the blocking case to improve efficiency\&.
.PP
The implementation contains extensive reporting macros (slightly modified PA_ENSURE and PA_UNLESS versions) and a useful stream dump routine to provide debugging feedback\&.
.PP
Output buffer priming via the user callback (i\&.e\&. paPrimeOutputBuffersUsingStreamCallback and friends) is not implemented yet\&. All output is primed with silence\&.
