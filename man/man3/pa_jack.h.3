.SS "\fBPaError\fP PaJack_SetClientName (\fBconst\fP char * name)"
Set the JACK client name\&.
.PP
During Pa_Initialize, When PA JACK connects as a client of the JACK server, it requests a certain name, which is for instance prepended to port names\&. By default this name is 'PortAudio'\&. The JACK server may append a suffix to the client name, in order to avoid clashes among clients that try to connect with the same name (e\&.g\&., different PA JACK clients)\&.
.PP
This function must be called before Pa_Initialize, otherwise it won't have any effect\&. Note that the string is not copied, but instead referenced directly, so it must not be freed for as long as PA might need it\&.
