.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A two-pass effect to reduce background noise\&. 

The first pass is done over just noise\&. For each windowed sample of the sound, we take a FFT and then statistics are tabulated for each frequency band\&.
.PP
During the noise reduction phase, we start by setting a gain control for each frequency band such that if the sound has exceeded the previously-determined threshold, the gain is set to 0 dB, otherwise the gain is set lower (e\&.g\&. -18 dB), to suppress the noise\&. Then time-smoothing is applied so that the gain for each frequency band moves slowly, and then frequency-smoothing is applied so that a single frequency is never suppressed or boosted in isolation\&. Lookahead is employed; this effect is not designed for real-time but if it were, there would be a significant delay\&.
.PP
The gain controls are applied to the complex FFT of the signal, and then the inverse FFT is applied\&. A Hanning window may be applied (depending on the advanced window types setting), and then the output signal is then pieced together using overlap/add\&.
