.IP "\fBMember \fBGetSubImageWithAlpha\fP (const wxImage &Src, const wxRect &rect)\fP" 1c
in wxWidgets, wxImage::GetSubImage should do this itself\&.  
.IP "\fBMember \fBThemeBase::LoadComponents\fP (bool bOkIfNotFound=false)\fP" 1c
(wxWidgets) A png may have been saved with alpha, but when you load it, it comes back with a mask instead! (well I guess it is more efficient)\&. Anyway, we want alpha and not a mask, so we call InitAlpha, and that transfers the mask into the alpha channel, and we're done\&.  
.IP "\fBMember \fBThemeBase::SaveComponents\fP ()\fP" 1c
1 in wxWidgets documentation; wxMkDir returns false if directory didn't exist, even if it successfully creates it\&. so we create and then test if it exists instead\&. 
.PP
2 in wxWidgets documentation; wxMkDir has only one argument under MSW
