.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
STK allpass interpolating delay line class\&. 

This \fBDelay\fP subclass implements a fractional-length digital delay-line using a first-order allpass filter\&. A fixed maximum length of 4095 and a delay of 0\&.5 is set using the default constructor\&. Alternatively, the delay and maximum length can be set during instantiation with an overloaded constructor\&.
.PP
An allpass filter has unity magnitude gain but variable phase delay properties, making it useful in achieving fractional delays without affecting a signal's frequency magnitude response\&. In order to achieve a maximally flat phase delay response, the minimum delay possible in this implementation is limited to a value of 0\&.5\&.
