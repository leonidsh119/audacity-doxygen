.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Allows registration and lookup (by name) of command types\&. 

A singleton\&. This fulfills a similar purpose to \fBCommandManager\fP, but for general Commands rather than menu items\&. Eventually they could be unified but for now they are kept separate to make things simpler\&.
