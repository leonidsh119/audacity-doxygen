Definition of 16 and 32 bit integer types (PaInt16, PaInt32 etc) 

SIZEOF_SHORT, SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_LONG are set by the configure script when it is used\&. Otherwise we default to the common 32 bit values, if your platform doesn't use configure, and doesn't use the default values below you will need to explicitly define these symbols in your make file\&.
.PP
A PA_VALIDATE_SIZES macro is provided to assert that the values set in this file are correct\&. 
.PP
Definition in file \fBpa_types\&.h\fP\&.
