.PP
Default constructor which seeds the random number generator with the system time\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 19 of file Noise\&.cpp\&.
.SS "Noise::Noise (unsigned \fBint\fP seed)"

.PP
Constructor which seeds the random number generator with a given seed\&. If the seed value is zero, the random number generator is seeded with the system time\&.
