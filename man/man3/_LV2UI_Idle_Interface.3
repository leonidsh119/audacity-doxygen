.SS "\fBint\fP(* _LV2UI_Idle_Interface::idle) (\fBLV2UI_Handle\fP ui)"
Run a single iteration of the UI's idle loop\&.
.PP
This will be called rapidly in the UI thread at a rate appropriate for a toolkit main loop\&. There are no precise timing guarantees, but the host should attempt to call \fBidle()\fP at a high enough rate for smooth animation, at least 30Hz\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
non-zero if the UI has been closed, in which case the host should stop calling \fBidle()\fP, and can either completely destroy the UI, or re-show it and resume calling \fBidle()\fP\&.
