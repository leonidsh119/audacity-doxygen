Normal usage should be:

.IP "\(bu" 2
Plugins include \fBvamp-sdk/Plugin\&.h\fP or \fBvamp-sdk/PluginBase\&.h\fP\&. These files include this header, which specifies an appropriate namespace for the plugin classes to avoid any risk of conflict with non-plugin class implementations in the host on load\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Hosts include \fBvamp-hostsdk/Plugin\&.h\fP, \fBvamp-hostsdk/PluginBase\&.h\fP, vamp-hostsdk/PluginHostAdapter, \fBvamp-hostsdk/PluginLoader\&.h\fP etc\&. These files include \fBvamp-hostsdk/hostguard\&.h\fP, which makes a note that we are in a host\&. A file such as \fBvamp-hostsdk/Plugin\&.h\fP then simply includes \fBvamp-sdk/Plugin\&.h\fP, and this guard header takes notice of the fact that it has been included from a host and leaves the plugin namespace unset\&.
.PP
.PP
Problems will occur when a host includes files directly from the vamp-sdk directory\&. There are two reasons this might happen: mistake, perhaps owing to ignorance of the fact that this isn't allowed (particularly since it was the normal mechanism in v1 of the SDK); and a wish to incorporate plugin code directly into the host rather than having to load it\&.
.PP
What if the host does include a vamp-sdk header by mistake? We can catch it if it's included before something from vamp-hostsdk\&. If it's included after something from vamp-hostsdk, it will work OK anyway\&. The remaining problem case is where nothing from vamp-hostsdk is included in the same file\&. We can't catch that\&.
