.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The \fBTrackInfo\fP is shown to the side of a track It has the menus, pan and gain controls displayed in it\&. So 'Info' is somewhat a misnomer\&. Should possibly be 'TrackControls'\&. 

\fBTrackPanel\fP and not \fBTrackInfo\fP takes care of the functionality for each of the buttons in that panel\&.
.PP
In its current implementation \fBTrackInfo\fP is not derived from a wxWindow\&. Following the original coding style, it has been coded as a 'flyweight' class, which is passed state as needed, except for the array of gains and pans\&.
.PP
If we'd instead coded it as a wxWindow, we would have an instance of this class for each instance displayed\&.
